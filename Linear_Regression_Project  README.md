Multiple Linear Regression â€” Student Score Predictor

This project demonstrates the use of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to predict student exam scores based on several factors:

Hours studied

Hours slept

Attendance percentage

Unlike simple linear regression (which uses one feature), multiple linear regression allows us to use multiple features to make more accurate predictions.

ðŸ”¹ What the Project Does

Builds and trains a multiple linear regression model using a sample dataset.

Uses three input features (study time, sleep hours, attendance) to predict exam scores.

Shows how each feature contributes to the final prediction.

ðŸ”¹ Why Itâ€™s Useful

Multiple Linear Regression is widely used when outcomes depend on more than one factor. This project provides:

Hands-on practice with multiple features.

A foundation for real-world problems like salary prediction, house pricing, and sales forecasting.

Understanding of how coefficients represent the weight of each factor.

ðŸ”¹ How to Run the Project

Open the Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab file.

Run all cells to train the model.

Change the input values (study hours, sleep, attendance) to test predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Example Prediction

For a student with:

6 hours studied

7 hours slept

85% attendance

The model might predict a score of 82 (out of 100).

ðŸ”¹ Skills and Tools Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

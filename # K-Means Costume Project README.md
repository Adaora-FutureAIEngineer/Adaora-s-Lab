# K-Means Costume Project

This project applies K-Means clustering to group customers into segments based on their age, income, and spending score.  
The goal is to help a costume business understand customer patterns and improve marketing strategies.  

The model automatically identifies similar customer groups, showing which segments spend more and how age or income affects purchasing behavior.

# Adaora-s-Lab
A collection of my experiments in AI engineering and machine learning â€” from beginner-friendly models to advanced projects. Documenting my journey as I build skills in Python, deep learning, and data science.

# Adaoraâ€™s Lab ðŸ§ª

Welcome to **Adaoraâ€™s Lab**, my personal space for learning, experimenting, and building projects in **Artificial Intelligence and AI Engineering**.  
This repository is a living portfolio where I document my journey as I explore how AI can solve real-world problems through **machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision**.  

---

## ðŸŒŸ Purpose
I created this repository to:  
- Track my progress as I study AI Engineering  
- Showcase projects that demonstrate practical AI applications  
- Build a portfolio that can be shared with employers, collaborators, and fellow learners  
- Share clear documentation so that anyone can understand and learn from my work

## ðŸ”® What to Expect
This lab will grow over time as I continue learning and building. Projects you will see here include:  
- **Machine Learning Models** â†’ Regression, classification, clustering, model evaluation  
- **Deep Learning** â†’ Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, transfer learning  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** â†’ Sentiment analysis, chatbots, embeddings  
- **Computer Vision** â†’ Image classification, object detection, real-world recognition tasks  
- **AI Deployment** â†’ Serving AI models with Flask, FastAPI, and Docker  

Each project will come with:  
- Clean, documented code  
- A README explaining the problem, dataset, approach, and results  
- Lessons learned and ideas for improvement

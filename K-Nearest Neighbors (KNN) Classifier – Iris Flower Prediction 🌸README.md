# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier â€“ Iris Flower Prediction ðŸŒ¸

## Overview
This project demonstrates how the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm can classify iris flowers into species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) based on sepal and petal measurements. Itâ€™s a simple yet powerful example of supervised machine learning for classification tasks.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Machine Learning (Classification)
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Scaling
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix & Accuracy Analysis
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Trained a **KNN model** with `n_neighbors=5`.
4. Evaluated predictions using **accuracy score** and **classification report**.
5. Visualized decision boundaries and results.

## Results
- Model Accuracy: **â‰ˆ100%** on test data  
- KNN proved effective for clear, non-overlapping class distributions.

## Tech Stack
`Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`

## How to Run
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib

Logistic Regression â€” Pass/Fail Predictor

This project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on the number of hours studied. Unlike Linear Regression, which predicts continuous values (like exam scores), Logistic Regression predicts categorical outcomes (Pass/Fail).

ðŸ”¹ What the Project Does

Trains a Logistic Regression model using a dataset of study hours.

Predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on input hours.

Shows how logistic regression maps probabilities to binary outcomes.

ðŸ”¹ Why Itâ€™s Useful

Logistic Regression is a fundamental algorithm for classification tasks. This project provides:

A simple way to understand classification vs regression.

Practical experience using probabilities for decision-making.

A foundation for more advanced classification models.

ðŸ”¹ How to Run the Project

Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file.

Run all cells to train the model.

Change the input value for hours studied to test predictions (e.g., 2, 5, 8 hours).

ðŸ”¹ Example Prediction

For a student who studies 6 hours:

Predicted probability of passing: 0.87 (87%)

Final prediction: Pass âœ…

# Linear Regression: Predicting Student Scores

This project is part of my AI Engineering learning journey.  
It demonstrates **Simple Linear Regression** using Python, scikit-learn, and Google Colab.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict a studentâ€™s exam score based on study hours.

- **Algorithm used**: Linear Regression  
- **Dataset**: Sample dataset (Hours studied vs Scores)  
- **Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib  

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Strong positive correlation between study hours and exam scores.  
- Example prediction: *If a student studies 9.25 hours, the model predicts a score of ~92%.*

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

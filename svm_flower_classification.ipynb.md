# SVM Flower Classification Project ðŸŒ¸

## Overview
This project demonstrates how **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** can be used for binary classification.  
Using the Iris dataset, the model classifies two types of flowers (Setosa vs Versicolor) based on their features and visualizes the decision boundary.

## Project Steps
1. Load the Iris dataset.
2. Select two flower classes for binary classification.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train an SVM model with a linear kernel.
5. Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.
6. Visualize the decision boundary separating the two classes.

## Results
- The model achieved high accuracy in classifying the two flower types.  
- The decision boundary clearly shows how SVM separates the categories.  

## Extended Description
This project demonstrates how Support Vector Machines (SVM) can classify data into two categories. Using the Iris dataset, the model separates two flower types with a linear boundary, achieving high accuracy. It is a simple example to understand SVM decision-making and visualization.

## Requirements

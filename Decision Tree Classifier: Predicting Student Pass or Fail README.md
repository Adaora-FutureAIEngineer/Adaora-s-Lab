# Decision Tree Classifier: Predicting Student Pass or Fail

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree Classifier in machine learning.  
The goal is to predict whether a student passes or fails based on their study hours and number of classes attended.  

## âš¡ Key Points
- Decision Tree splits data into branches based on feature values.  
- Uses `criterion="entropy"` to measure information gain.  
- Visualizes the decision process in a tree-like structure.  

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- Python  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  

## ðŸ“Š Output
- Predictions of student performance.  
- A decision tree visualization showing classification rules.

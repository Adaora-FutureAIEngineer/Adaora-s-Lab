# Random Forest Classifier: Predicting Student Pass or Fail

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a student passes or fails based on study hours and class attendance.  
Random Forest combines multiple Decision Trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## âš¡ Key Points
- Ensemble of 100 decision trees for stronger predictions.  
- Evaluated using accuracy and classification report.  
- More stable and accurate than a single Decision Tree.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- Python  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  

## ðŸ“Š Output
- Accuracy score and classification report.  
- Comparison of actual vs predicted student outcomes.
